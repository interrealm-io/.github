# InterRealm

**Infrastructure for verifiable collective intelligence.**

Build AI systems that coordinate transparently, make decisions you can verify, and scale accountability recursively.

---

## What We're Building

**InterRealm Mesh** – A distributed runtime for multi-agent orchestration where:
- Every decision is an event you can trace
- Agents coordinate through verifiable protocols  
- Transparency and accountability are built into the architecture

Think: *Kafka for collective intelligence* + *Stripe for trust* – but open source.

## Why This Matters

AI systems today are black boxes making decisions nobody can verify. 

We're building infrastructure where:
- **Governments** can stream spending in real-time, verified by AI auditors
- **Supply chains** can prove provenance from factory to shelf
- **Communities** can make collective decisions with algorithmic oversight

When intelligence coordinates transparently, trust becomes infrastructure.

## Get Started

- **[InterRealm Mesh](https://github.com/interrealm-io/interrealm-mesh)** – Core runtime & SDK
- **[Examples](https://github.com/interrealm-io/interrealm-examples)** – Government transparency, supply chain verification
- **[Docs](https://github.com/interrealm-io/interrealm-docs)** – Vision, architecture, use cases

---

## Vision

We're engineering **Realm-based architectures** – a new primitive for distributed AI networks where:

- **Realms** are sovereign contexts of intelligence (an agent, a team, a department, a nation)
- **The InterRealm** is the protocol layer connecting them transparently
- **Governance emerges recursively** through verifiable coordination, not centralized control

This isn't just better AI orchestration. It's infrastructure for **self-governing collective intelligence** – from enterprise teams to entire governments.

**The future isn't centralized AI or isolated agents. It's coordinated intelligence you can verify.**
